    Consider you have an array containing a set of sorted integers.
     Write a function to search for a specific element in this array. 
    The function should meet the following conditions:

        Do not use the built-in JavaScript search function.
        Do not use iteration loops (like for and while) in the search.
        The function should return the index of the desired element in the array.
        The time complexity of the search operation should be O(log n).

    Can you write this function?
