    //This code is performing an asynchronous operation to fetch user data from an API endpoint. Let's break it down:

//1. `requestData` is an object containing the data to be sent in the request. In this case, it specifies the method to be invoked on the server (`getUsers`).

//2. `fetch('/api', { method: 'POST', body: JSON.stringify(requestData) })` initiates a POST request to the `/api` endpoint, sending `requestData` as the request body in JSON format.

//3. The `.then()` method is chained to the fetch operation. This method is executed when the fetch operation is complete and receives the response from the server. It checks if the response is successful (`response.ok`). If not, it throws an error.

//4. If the response is successful, it parses the response body as JSON using `response.json()`. Another `.then()` method is chained to handle the parsed JSON data.

//5. In this second `.then()` block, `responseData.users` is returned. This assumes that the response from the server contains a property named `users` with the user data.

//6. Finally, another `.then()` is attached to `usersPromise` to handle the resolved value, which is the array of users. If successful, it logs the known users to the console. If there's an error at any point in the promise chain, it's caught in the `catch` block and logs an error message.

//Overall, this code fetches user data from an API endpoint using POST method, processes the response, and logs the users to the console if successful, or logs an error message if there's any failure.
